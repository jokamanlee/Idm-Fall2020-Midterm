Concept:

    API's:

    Studio Ghibli: https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#

    giphy: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide

2> Figure out how to display this thesis/idea

-What do we want to say? What is our angle?

Display a ghibli movie and its basic information with a nice gif from the movie 

Having a nav bar or a way for users to choose a certain movie 
the gif will pop up on one side and next to it would be the basic information of the movie
